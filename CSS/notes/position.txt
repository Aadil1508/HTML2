Position is used to keep element wherever we want.

There are 5 positions available in css.
1. static-- by default all elements will have static. top,left,right,bottom will not have any impact

2.Relative : it will conside left,right,bottom,top based on its previous positions

3. absolute: it will consider always position on body, when you say top:0, it will go fot top 0 of body

4. fixed: it is exactly same as absolute but scrolling does not affect it.

5. sticky: relative+fixed . after reaching mentioned lengths , it will becomes sticky
