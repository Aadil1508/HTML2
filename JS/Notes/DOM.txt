Object contains key value pairs, it may contain data or methods
obj={
    name:"raj",
    age:20
}
obj.age ===> objectname.keyname== value
obj["age"]==>value

whole Js is operated by Window Object. window is global object. whole HTML,css is stored as a tree inside an object called document. 
using this "document" object you can change,create,update HTML/css
that is called DOM(document object model) manipulation


1. selection:
  i. we can select the element by tagname
   document.getElementsByTagName('tagname')

  ii. we can select the element by class name
  document.getElementsByClassName('classname')

  Note: tagname and classname returns array(HTMLCollection)

  iii.we can select the element by Id.
  document.getElementById('idname')

  iv. we can select the element by CSS Query 
  document.querySelector('query')

  But query selector selects the first element only which satistfies query

  v. we can select all elements satisfying the condition by querySelectorALL()

2. Manipulation:  
you can maipulate the value of any selected element by three functions

  i. textContent
    textContent is used to manipulate/take the text inside the selected element
  ii. innerText
   innerText is used to manipulate/take the text inside the selected element but innerText also checks CSS and fails if visibility is hidden
  iii. innerHTML
   innerHTML actually takes the code and reads it before manipulation
