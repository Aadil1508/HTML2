JS is synchronous(line by line), single threaded (one task at a time) language
Some times we need to perform taasks which takes a time.

Timers: every browser have a web API names timers. There are two timers,
setTimeOut(): it runs fns after specific time only once
setInterVal(): it runs fns after specific time again and again
setTimeout(fn,time in milli seconds)

API(Application Programming Interface):
Application interact with each other for data/service through API's.
Every point points to an End Point. End point is where the data locates/ user points.

In olden times, we used to use XmlHttpRequest(XHR) but modern browsers supports fetch which takes an url end point and results data.
