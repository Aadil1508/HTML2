Events trigger actions like functions
There are so many types of Events
MouseEvents: initiated by mouse.
click,bdlclick,mouseover,mouseout etc.,
KeyBoardEvents: initiated keyboard buttons
formEvents: onchange,oninput,onselect,onsubmit
window events:global events

onclick etc.., are called event handlers but to trigger events in js , we use event listeners.
event listners creates an object which waits until the specified action/event got done

Event propagation means how events travel or executed one by one
